 Sorry someone who uses

2
0:0:1,620 --> 0:0:2,840
 sleep code. In case you

3
0:0:2,600 --> 0:0:3,780
 do, every time you solve

4
0:0:3,240 --> 0:0:4,360
 a question or

5
0:0:3,840 --> 0:0:5,80
 lead code you definitely

6
0:0:5,160 --> 0:0:6,420
 want to know where was

7
0:0:6,180 --> 0:0:7,480
 this question asked because

8
0:0:6,740 --> 0:0:8,0
 that is something

9
0:0:7,640 --> 0:0:8,940
 that gets your confidence

10
0:0:9,0 --> 0:0:10,580
 super high but unfortunately

11
0:0:10,300 --> 0:0:11,520
 you cannot do it because

12
0:0:11,140 --> 0:0:12,280
 for that you need an

13
0:0:12,440 --> 0:0:13,580
 active lead code. Premium

14
0:0:13,620 --> 0:0:14,740

15
0:0:14,240 --> 0:0:15,400

 need to do is you need

19
0:0:17,20 --> 0:0:18,280
 to add this big omega

20
0:0:18,340 --> 0:0:19,880
 extension to your troll.

21
0:0:19,480 --> 0:0:20,760

22
0:0:20,660 --> 0:0:21,740
 you can load any of the

23
0:0:21,340 --> 0:0:22,540

0:0:23,300 --> 0:0:24,460
